# About
AI tools Integration in iOS app

# Frameworks & Tools
 - **ChatGPT:** API based ChatGPT model use.
 - **Gemini:** API based Gemini model use.
 - **Core ML:** For running machine learning models directly on the device (on-device AI) for speed and privacy, handling image, text, and sound analysis.
 - **Vision API:** Powers computer vision tasks like face, object, and text detection within images.
 - **SiriKit/App Intents:** Enables voice commands and hands-free app interaction through Siri.
 - **Create ML:** Simplifies training custom machine learning models without complex coding.
 - **Apple Intelligence:** Apple's new personal intelligence system integrating powerful generative models system-wide for new features within apps and across the OS. 

# Integration Methods
 - **On-Device AI:** Use Core ML for fast, offline functionality and enhanced privacy.
 - **Cloud-Based AI (APIs):** Connect to external services like OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Llama via web APIs for complex tasks (e.g., advanced chatbots).
 - **Hybrid Approach:** Combine on-device processing for speed with cloud models for advanced capabilities.
